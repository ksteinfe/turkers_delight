Upload your competed collection of 64 images here, and describe them in this text document.

I am working on a project this semester for Civil Engineering 209: Design for Sustainable Communities.  My team will be trying to solve the problem of 
overcrowding in Pune, India by designing affordable urban housing that is scalable, safe, and responsive to energy and environmental concerns, while still
remaining culturally contextutual.

To assemble my collection of 64 images, I searched for images that depict the typical overcrowded living situations in Indian housing.
I used the following filters in Google:
India housing, India low income housing, India vernacular architecture, India traditional architecture, India slums, India urban housing,
India overcrowded housing, Pune India, Pune India city, Pune India slums, Pune India housing, Pune India affordable housing, Low cost housing
