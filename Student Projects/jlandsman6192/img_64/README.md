I am working on a project this semester for Civil Engineering 209: Design for Sustainable Communities.  My team will be trying to solve the problem 
of overcrowding in Pune, Inda by designing affordable urban housing that is scalable, safe, and responsive to energy and environmental concerns, while
still remaining culturally contextutual.

To assemble my collection of 64 images, I used the following filters in Google:
India housing
India low income housing
India vernacular architecture
India traditional architecture
India slums
India urban housing
India overcrowded housing
Pune India
Pune India city
Pune India slums
Pune India housing
Pune India affordable housing
Low cost housing

My collection now consists of images that depict typical overcrowded Indian living situations.
