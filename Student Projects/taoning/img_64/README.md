In order to design a theatre for Hamlet performance, I searched images of Hamlet. Preliminary search divides
the collection into three categories: book cover, man holding skulls, and movie posters. Everyone has his or
her own Hamlet in mind. I hope, by doing crowdsourcing around this theme, to find different characteristics 
of Hamlet and integrate these elements into the architecture that hosts the performance.
