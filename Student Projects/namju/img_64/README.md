key_word = streets

My main topic of my studio and fabrication is about designing space on streets.
Through watching the images, we are able to have a time to think of streets differently. While some images are 
exposing different problems of the street , some images encourage us to consider diverse potentials of use of 
street. In term of problems of some streets, we are not only able to raise questions, but also we improve the 
current street condition based on the potentials of the street.
By watching the pictures, we read that...
